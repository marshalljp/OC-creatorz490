Working:
- On-board network
- Airdrop
- USB 3.x
- Airplay
- Everything not listed below

Maybe Working:
- Thunderbolt 3 (The OS sees the controller but I have no TB devices)
- Handoff (Never used it)

Not Working:
- DRM.  No plans to support the hack in Big Sur and beyond.
- My 1TB USB disk for timemachine, for some reason.  Windows sees it, BIOS sees it, MacOS does not.  Update:  After waking from sleep the disk showed up.  Not sure if it's here to stay.
